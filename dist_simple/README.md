## üîß Ultra-Advanced Compression Techniques

### 1. UltraSketchLLM - Sub-1-Bit Compression

Achieves compression down to 0.5 bits per weight using data sketching techniques.

### 2. SliM-LLM - Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision

Improves accuracy at ultra-low bit-widths through intelligent bit allocation.

### 3. OneBit - 1-Bit Parameter Representation

Enables 1-bit compression through novel parameter representation methods.

### 4. PTQ1.61 - Sub-2-Bit Quantization

Pushes quantization to extremely low bit counts while minimizing performance degradation.

### 5. Super Weight Preservation

Identifies and preserves critical parameters that disproportionately affect model behavior.

### 6. Enhanced SparseGPT & Wanda Pruning

One-shot pruning techniques that remove up to 95% of weights without retraining.

### 7. CALR - Corrective Adaptive Low-Rank Decomposition

Advanced decomposition technique that compensates for information loss during compression.
